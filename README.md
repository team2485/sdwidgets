# Team 2485's Custom Smart Dashboard Widgets

These can be used to add functionality and customize the look and feel of the
default SmartDashboard.

List of Widgets:

 - Background Hack
 - Cool Bool (better booleans)
 - Large Text
 - Logo Connection Indicator
 - Nyan Cats (static and data-driven)
 - Pandaboard Connection Indicator
 - Potentiometer

The Smart Dashboard widget JARs are generated in `extensions/` so that they can
be easily tested by running `SmartDashboard.jar`, using the default extension
directory. Use `SmartDashboardDebug.bat` to quickly tese the functionality of
the built widgets.
